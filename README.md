# Movies React 

This challenge was to connect to the Movie Database API to retrieve the list of genres and the list of trending movies on page load. 
When a user clicks on one of the filter buttons, this retrieves movies by this particular genre.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
